Multi-Environment WordPress wp-config.php
=============

This wp-config.php file can be used in multiple environments (local, staging, production). It works by detecting the server hostname and defining different constants depending on which hostname is used.

It also defines an ENVIRONMENT constant with a value equal to DEVELOPMENT, STAGING or PRODUCTION.
